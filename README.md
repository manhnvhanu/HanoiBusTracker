# HanoiBusTracker

This is my graduate thesis for the 2015-2016 academic year

The primary objective of this project is developing a real time bus tracking system which is intended to collect and distribute bus position data using an Android application.

This application is:
  - A combination of built-in GPS and a native android application to keep track bus position by sending real time data to server continuously.
  - Using Firebase as a real-time database server.
  - Using Firebase libraries, Google Map API to download data and visualize on user interface.
